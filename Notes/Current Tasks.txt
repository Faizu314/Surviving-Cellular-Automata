Constants in Tiles Generator {
	Read them from a text file im sick of recompiling
}

A* Optimizations {
	Add a Weight to overestimate Heuristic: Cost = g(x) + h(x) * W
	Maybe use octile distance: max(dx, dy) + (sqrt(2) - 1) * min(dx, dy)
}

Cellular Automata Step {
	Iterations are not being computed correctly on currently: correctly swap iterative and initialTiles
}

Tiles Pooling {
	Further manage tiles within chunks to only load local tiles
}
