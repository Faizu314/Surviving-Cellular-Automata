Unexplored Fog {
	Use camera stencil buffer
	First the unexplored tiles will be used to make 2D mesh which will use StencilWrite material
	This mesh will be rendered FIRST (Using queue) and stencil buffer will be updated to 1
	Then the remaining screen will be rendered with fog where stencil != 1
	REF: Field of view visualisation (E03: stencil shader)
}

Floor Tiles {
	Procedurally generate them like the walls so they come up in the depth matrix
}

Tiles Pooling {
	currently still pooling around 1k gameObjects... :/
}

Continuous Tile Values {
	Automata template should be a matrix of rules
	use float instead of bool (Refer to Notes Photo)
}

A* Optimizations {
	Add a Weight to overestimate Heuristic: Cost = g(x) + h(x) * W
	Maybe use octile distance: max(dx, dy) + (sqrt(diagonal) - 1) * min(dx, dy)
}
