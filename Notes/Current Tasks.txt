Atomic Modelling {
	Bonding and molecules
}

Fundamental Lengths Generations {
	Gen 1 {
		3 lengths
	}
	Gen 2 {
		A few sum of combinations of prev gen
		A few new random lengths
	}
	And so on.
}

//////////// TERRAIN GENERATION /////////////////


Connector {
	Doesn't work redo
	All of it
	Path clings to the boundaries and reveals them
}

Unexplored Fog {
	//Fog seems to be pretty complicated lets work with current shader for now//
	Use camera stencil buffer
	First the unexplored tiles will be used to make 2D mesh which will use StencilWrite material
	This mesh will be rendered FIRST (Using queue) and stencil buffer will be updated to 1
	Then the remaining screen will be rendered with fog where stencil != 1
	REF: Field of view visualisation (E03: stencil shader)
}

Floor Tiles {
	Procedurally generate them like the walls so they come up in the depth matrix
}

Tiles Pooling {
	currently still pooling around 1k gameObjects... :/
}

A* Alterations {
	Add a Weight to overestimate Heuristic: Cost = g(x) + h(x) * W
	Maybe use octile distance: max(dx, dy) + (sqrt(diagonal) - 1) * min(dx, dy)
}
