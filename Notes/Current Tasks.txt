Tiles Pooling {
	Further manage tiles within chunks to only load local tiles
}

Continuous Tile Values {
	Automata template should be a matrix of rules
	use float instead of bool (Refer to Notes Photo)
}

Map Data Saver {
	There should only be one dictionary and different chunks can have different number of stages
}

A* Optimizations {
	Add a Weight to overestimate Heuristic: Cost = g(x) + h(x) * W
	Maybe use octile distance: max(dx, dy) + (sqrt(diagonal) - 1) * min(dx, dy)
}
