Maybe there should be multiple types of MapChunks
Some may take less than O(N*N) operations to render like the rooms chunk. But exploration saver will have to account for this
and endless cavern will have to know in advance which chunk it is adding to the list.


Fixing the automata map {
	divide the chunk into n by n partitions
	In each parition:
	apply flood fill until all fillers are done using a filler object
	every filler object marks a floor using a "REFERENCE" to an identifier
	if two filler objects meet they alter the "REFERENCE_TABLE" to mark both sections as one
	as its filling it will keep encapsulating new squares/bounds in its bound.

	After each partition has been explored:
	go through the borders and merge neighboring bounds.
	for each bound1 pick a point inside it and find a bound2 that contains the closest point, then from that point find the closest point in bound1.
	Connect these two points together using some algo i haven't figured out yet.
