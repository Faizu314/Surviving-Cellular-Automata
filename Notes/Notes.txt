Future Plans:

Biomes {
	Biomes using different CA rules and different algorithms
	Blend between different Biomes
	Use entirely different algorithms to generate special chunks
}

Threading {
	Queues of thread requests with priority ordering in each queue
	A tick system where each background activity will be dispatched at its turn and has its own queue
	Control the concurrent threads dispatched at a time
}
